# Silent Failure of `content: url()` in CSS when Image is Missing

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to using the `content: url()` property in CSS.  When the specified image does not exist, there's no error message or warning; instead, the pseudo-element simply remains empty.

**Problem:** The CSS uses `content: url()` to display an image. If the image is missing, this leads to no visual indication of the problem.

**Solution:** Implement a fallback mechanism such as a default image or a visual indicator that the image is missing.

This is a challenging bug to debug since the browser doesn't provide informative feedback. This example highlights the importance of thorough testing and robust error handling.
